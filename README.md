# World Happiness Report – Tableau Dashboard

This project explores global happiness trends using data from the **World Happiness Report**, visualized through an interactive Tableau dashboard. The analysis breaks down overall life evaluation scores and their underlying components to compare happiness across countries and over time.

## Project Overview

The dashboard allows users to:
- Compare **overall happiness rankings** across countries
- Decompose happiness scores into key contributing factors
- Analyze **trends over time** for selected countries
- Explore global patterns using an interactive world map
- Filter results dynamically by **year**, **country**, and **metric**

The goal of this project is to demonstrate skills in **data visualization, exploratory analysis, and dashboard design** using Tableau.

## Key Metrics Analyzed

The World Happiness score is composed of the following factors:
- Log GDP per capita  
- Social support  
- Healthy life expectancy  
- Freedom to make life choices  
- Generosity  
- Perceptions of corruption  
- Dystopia + residual  

These components are visualized both individually and as part of a combined score to show how different factors contribute to overall happiness.


## 📈 Dashboard Components

- **Combined Rankings (Stacked Bar Chart)**  
  Displays total happiness scores by country, broken down by contributing factors.

- **Rankings Table**  
  Sortable table showing country rankings and individual metric values.

- **Time Series Line Chart**  
  Tracks selected happiness metrics over time for multiple countries.

- **World Map**  
  Visualizes global happiness distribution by country.

- **Interactive Filters**

## 🔑 Key Insights

- **Nordic countries consistently rank highest in overall happiness**, with Finland, Denmark, and Iceland leading across most years. Their scores are driven less by a single factor and more by strong performance across GDP, social support, and institutional trust.

- **Social support is one of the strongest and most stable contributors** to happiness across top-ranked countries, often differentiating high-performing nations even when GDP levels are similar.

- **Economic prosperity alone does not guarantee higher happiness**. Several countries with high GDP per capita rank lower due to weaker scores in freedom, corruption perception, or social support.

- **Happiness trends are not static over time**. The time-series view shows noticeable shifts for some countries, highlighting how social and economic changes impact life evaluation scores year over year.

- **Lower-ranked countries tend to have higher “Dystopia + residual” values**, suggesting that unmeasured factors and structural challenges play a larger role where institutional and economic supports are weaker.

- **Geographic clustering is visible on the global map**, with higher happiness concentrated in Northern Europe and lower scores more common in parts of Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.
